<h1>Bulls and Cows</h1>
<p>A game of logic</p>
=================================================

Try it <a href="http://lutory.github.io/bulls_and_cows/index.html">here</a>

<h2>Rules</h2>


The cow thinks of a 4-digit number with no repeating digits and without 0. Your goal is to guess that number in 10 tries. The cow will give you the following clues everytime you try to guess:

 - The number of Bulls - digits correct in the right position.
 -The number of Cows - digits correct but in the wrong position.

For example, the cow comes up with the number 8137. Your guess is 1234. You have 1 bull for the 3 because not only is in the cow's number but in the right position. You have also 1 cow for the 1 that is presented in the cow's number but in a wrong position.

Now can you guess it?
